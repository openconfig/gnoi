# Bazel Central Registry

When this project is released, we want to publish to the
[Bazel Central Registry](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-central-registry)
automatically. This folder contains the configuration files to automate the
publishing. See
[publish-to-bcr](https://github.com/bazel-contrib/publish-to-bcr) for more
information.
