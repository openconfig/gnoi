// The OS service provides an interface for OS installation on a Target. The
// Client progresses through 3 RPCs:
//   1) Installation - provide the Target with the OS package.
//   2) Activation - activate an installed OS package.
//   3) Verification - verify that the Activation was successful.
//
// Dual Supervisor Target is supported, where the above process is executed once
// for the whole Target or once for each Supervisor. Targets that require the 
// above process executed once per Supervisor will reply with the flag
// Verify->VerifyResponse->individual_supervisor_install set to true.
//
// Note that certain platforms may have particular approaches to upgrade the
// firmware of specific components, eg., power supply units, etc.. In addition,
// platforms may have processes to apply patches to the running OS. Handling
// these exceptions introduces extra complexities. For Targets that implement
// this service, component firmware upgrade or OS patching MUST be embedded
// within an OS upgrade.
service OS {
  // Install transfers an OS package into the Target. No concurrent Install RPCs
  // MUST be allowed to the same Target.
  //
  // The OS package file format is platform dependent. The platform MUST
  // validate that the OS package that is supplied is valid and bootable. This
  // SHOULD include a hash check against a known good hash. It is recommended
  // that the hash is embedded in the OS package.
  //
  // The Target manages its own persistent storage, and OS installation process.
  // It stores a set of distinct OS packages, and always proactively frees up
  // space for incoming new OS packages. It is guaranteed that the Target always
  // has enough space for a valid incoming OS package. The currently running OS
  // packages MUST never be removed. The Client MUST expect that the last
  // successfully installed package is available.
  //
  // The Install RPC allows the Client to specify the OS package version. If
  // the Target already has an OS package with the same version then there is no
  // need to transfer the OS package to the Target. If the Target does not have
  // an OS package with the same version, then the OS package is copied.
  //
  // Scenario 1 - When the Target already has the OS package:
  //
  //         Client :--------------|--------------> Target
  //              TransferRequest -->
  //                              <-- [Validated|InstallError]
  //
  //
  // Scenario 2 - When the Target does not have the OS package:
  //
  //         Client :--------------|--------------> Target
  //              TransferRequest -->
  //                              <-- [TransferReady|InstallError]
  //            transfer_content  -->

  //                  TransferEnd -->
  //                              <-- [Validated|InstallError]
  //
  // On a dual Supervisor Target which requires installing the entire 
  // system with one Install RPC, one Install RPC is sufficient to 
  // install the package on all Supervisors.
  // On a dual Supervisor Target which requires one Install RPC per 
  // supervisor, the Install RPC applies to the Active Supervisor unless 
  // InstallRequest->TransferRequest->standby_supervisor is set, in which 
  // case it applies to the Standby Supervisor. The Target MUST accept any 
  // order of package installation.
  // On a dual Supervisor Target which requires installing the entire 
  // system with one Install RPC, the package MUST be made available on 
  // all Supervisors or none. If upon installation the package is absent 
  // from either Supervisor, the Target will transfer to both Supervisors 
  // overwriting the existing one.
  // On a dual Supervisor Target which requires one Install RPC per 
  // supervisor, the Target MUST always attempt to copy the OS package 
  // between Supervisors first before accepting the transfer from the 
  // Client. The syncing progress is reported to the client with 
  // InstallResponse->SyncProgress messages.
  //
  // If a switchover is triggered during the Install RPC, the RPC MUST
  // immediately abort with Error->type->UNEXPECTED_SWITCHOVER.
  //
  // Scenario 3 - When both Supervisors already have the OS package, regardless
  //              of the value in Start.standby_supervisor:
  //
  //         Client :--------------|--------------> Target
  //              TransferRequest -->
  //                              <-- [Validated|InstallError]
  //
  //
  // Scenario 4 - On a dual Supervisor Target which requires one Install RPC
  // per supervisor, and when one of the Supervisors already has the OS 
  // package but the other Supervisor is the target of the Install:
  //
  //         Client :--------------|--------------> Target
  //              TransferRequest -->
  //                              <-- [SyncProgress|InstallError]
  //                              ...
  //                              <-- [Validated|InstallError]
  //
  //
  // Scenario 5 - When neither of the two Supervisors has the OS package:
  //
  //         Client :--------------|--------------> Target
  //              TransferRequest -->
  //                              <-- [TransferReady|InstallError]
