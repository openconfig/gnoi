// frontpanel or backplane port on a chassis. In OpenConfig YANG models, there
// is a one-to-one relationship between a port as used here and an "interface".
// Therefore, the "types.Path" fields below for ports correspond to

service PacketLinkQual {
  // Packet based link qualification related RPCs.

  // Starts packet based link qualification on a set of interfaces. Each start
  // operation is uniquely identified by an ID supplied by the caller. This ID
  // must be used by other operations (e.g., stop, get results, etc.) to select
  // the test associated with the ID. Caller specifies the minimum wait time
  // before warming up the link, number of packets, and preparation time to warm
  // up the link, and the actual duration of the qualification. It also
  // specifies if the interface under test is used as a near-end/ far-end from
  // the test perspective. On receiving the request, the device performs the
  // setup, and qualifies the link for the supplied test duration. The device
  // keeps the results until the corresponding stop request. Each start response
  // matches with a corresponding unique operation ID. If there is any error
  // starting the qualification, status is populated with canonical error code
  // and message to denote the details.

  // stop request for an interface which has completed qualification, as long as
  // the recorded operation ID matches the one specified by the request. Devices
  // should clean up at stop request. Each stop response matches with a
